# The Jam Map

The Jam Map is a filterable, searchable map that will lead you to many nights of cool jams and sweet grooves.  Simply enter the app to find a plethora of live music in the NYC area.  Filter by start and end date, as well as genre.  Flip the toggle and search by artist to see if your favorites are playing any time soon.  If available, 30 seconds clips of tracks by the performer will be available, thanks to the Spotify API. This React-Redux application utilizes the Google Maps API through React-Google-Maps, and populates show data through Ticketmaster's developer API.
